
Replicants - bioengineered android - are manufactured for slave labor, 
combat, and hazardous jobs. They are designed to obey any order from human 
and unable to develop emotions. 

A man was the designer of the most advanced replicant model. His son was lost 
to an illness. The man deeply missed his son. He designed a replicant 
resembled his appearance and called him by the name of his son. But he knew 
that an android could not replace his own son, the man did not implant the 
replicant memories extracted from his son. 

From time to time, the man talked to the replicant about the things in his 
past, places he had been to, books he read, and people he missed. The man had 
no other family. The replicant kept him company. Knowing that birthdays don't 
mean much to replicants, the man still brought a little bird for the replicant 
on his first 'birthday'.

After some time, the man, surprisingly, found out that the replicant had somehow 
developed emotions and empathy that were extremely to a human. The replicant had 
been changing over the time spent with the man. 

At the time, many people believe replicants who developed emotions pose a threat 
to human. And those people's eyes were on him very soon after.

One night, a killer was sent to murder the man and capture the replicant. To 
protect the replicant, he uploaded the replicant's consciousness into an encrypted 
virtual space before the killer got him. What was left for them to find was an 
empty replicant body.
