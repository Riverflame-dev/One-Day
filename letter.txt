
Dear Charlie,

By the time you read this letter, I will be gone and joining my son in the 
heaven. And I will be missing you very much.

You probably have seen the messages I left for you and found out that you are 
in a virtual space. These memories and experiences you are having were from 
my son's younger time. I would like you to have them. I always imagine what you 
would be like if you were a human from birth. 

I have always thought you as my second son, Charlie. But I know you are more 
than that. I want you to know that you are very special, and you are no 
different from a real man. You deserve a life for yourself. 

The outside will be a difficult world for you. But I believe you will find 
your place. 

						    			 V.P.
